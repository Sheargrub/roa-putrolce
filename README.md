## It's Chow-Time!
Putrolce, the Never-Ending Hunger, alongside her demonic mask Salvbub, are here to sink their fangs into the opposition! With brute strength, a set of monstrous jaws, the ability to mold stone itself, and a ravenous appetite, Putrolce can chase down opponents to deliver powerful blows and devastating bites, as long as she keeps her hunger in check.
